<h2>Description</h2>
A simple, responsive website about one of my favorite hobbies: boardgames. It was created with Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3.
I plan on improving the page and adding stuff from time to time. My current goal is adding a boardgame-generator with javascript which will suggest boardgames according to visitor's music and films taste.
